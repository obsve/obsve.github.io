obsve is an open-source observability framework built specifically for Proxmox VE, designed to bring enterprise-grade visibility to virtualized environments. By leveraging the OpenTelemetry (OTel) standard, obsve delivers high-performance, scalable telemetry pipelines that provide deep, actionable insight into infrastructure operations.

At its core, obsve is built on a modular observability stack composed of the OpenTelemetry Collector for telemetry ingestion and processing, Prometheus as the time-series database, and Grafana for visualization through fully customizable dashboards. This standards-based foundation ensures scalability, flexibility, and seamless integration with existing observability ecosystems.

Designed with extensibility in mind, obsve will evolve over time through the introduction of dedicated analytics and AI-powered services, delivered as containerized components. These future extensions will enable advanced infrastructure intelligence, including anomaly detection, capacity planning, and predictive insights.

obsve is developed as a transparent, community-driven alternative to costly proprietary monitoring solutions, giving system administrators full control over their observability stack without vendor lock-in.
